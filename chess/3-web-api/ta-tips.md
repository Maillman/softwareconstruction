## 5 Pro tips

5 Pro tips for solving your own coding problems (#4 will surprise you):

1. **Read the error messages.** The computer doesn’t lie, and it even tells you exactly which line caused the problem!
2. **Read the specs.** The document is long, but it’s not redundant— it’s helpful. All the information has been carefully placed in there to help YOU as a student.
3. **Search Slack.** It’s really to ask a new question, but first try to use the search feature to find a pre-existing answer.
4. **Write your own tests.** Yes, it was convenient in the first phases when we had done that for you, but now we’re expecting you to do this yourself. The Phase 3 tests are intentionally less helpful than before. Rely on manual testing, or write your own tests from the beginning.
5. **Appreciate the learning opportunity.** We (the instructors) designed this course to teach you new things. You are supposed to wrestle with new concepts and challenges, but it is possible. Think through the problems; you can do it!
