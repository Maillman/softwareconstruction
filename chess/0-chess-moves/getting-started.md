# Chess Game - Getting Started

📁 [Starter code](starter-code)

Take the following steps to set up your Chess project.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have already completed the deliverable for creating your [Chess GitHub Repository](../chess-github-repository/chess-github-repository.md).

## Open With IntelliJ

Open the project directory in IntelliJ to start developing, running, and debugging your code using an IDE. Make sure you **OPEN** the project rather than creating a new project. The contents of the folder already contain IntelliJ configuration files and creating a new project rather than opening an existing one will cause various errors.

> [!NOTE]
> If you get a prompt asking you to build with Maven, then make sure you skip that action.

Your project should look like this when it opens with the client, server, and shared folders having a blue square and being at the root level. There should be no folder called chess showing up in your Intelij project, only the items inside of the chess folder should be visible.
