# Phase 4 Database â€” Debugging Tips

Since Phase 4 requires interacting with an external program (the MySQL database), the likelihood of having auto-grader test output different from your local output is higher than previous phases. The most common issues are summarized here to save you time spent frustrated with a new technology.


## If your code doesn't pass on your own computer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your code should be able to create the database and tables correctly when the server is run. This is done with the `CREATE __ IF NOT EXISTS __` section of the code. 

#### Database and Table Creation

Make sure that your code has these statements somewhere, and make sure that they are called before any method tries to access the database. For example, if someone is going to register a user, all the databases should be created before hand, or else when it tries to check the database to see if the username has already been taken, it will throw an error since you have no database.

Also make sure that your create statements are in correct SQL Format. A good example can be found in Pet Shop.

#### Altering Tables

- Since the tables are created at startup, if you change your create statement to store `game` as LONGTEXT instead of VARCHAR(100), this update will not be seen until you either `ALTER TABLE` or `DROP TABLE`
  - Alter Table allows you to change your table, such as to add a new column
  - Drop Table will completely delete your whole table, completely deleting all data currently on it, which would allow you to recreate it with your `CREATE TABLE` statement, which can include your newly updated column variable types
  - This [Git Hub Link](https://github.com/softwareconstruction240/softwareconstruction/blob/main/instruction/db-sql/db-sql.md#altering-tables) contains a bit more explanation and some examples, not only of altering tables, but other important information about mySQL Tables.

After you have altered your table, then you should be able to rerun your code, and check your database to see if the update was successful. 


## If your code does pass on your own computer but not on the AutoGrader

#### Database and Table Creation

If your local tests are passing but the autograder isn't passing, there might be something different about your database and table creation than you might assume

Since your code will only create the database and tables if it isn't created already, it might be possible that you changed the code sometime while your database and table was still created, so it never actually updated your local SQL database. 

Try the following steps to reproduce the problem on your local machine:
1. Drop your database/schema using an external tool (MySQL shell or workbench).
2. Rerun the tests locally.
3. If they fail, double-check the code for creating the database and tables.


#### Hardcoded Database Name

It's fun to assume that your database will always be named "chess", but the AutoGrader will break that assumption!

The auto-grader inserts a new `db.properties` file for grading with most of the values different from those in your file. (For example, instead of calling the database chess, it will call it chess123456)

Run through the following verifications in your code:
- Check for any place you may have hardcoded any values from `db.properties`.
- Check each SQL statement, including where you create tables, for the database name.
  - For example, use `INSERT INTO table` instead of `INSERT INTO database.table`.
- The `getConnection` method inside `DatabaseManager` already sets up the connection to use your database,
  so you shouldn't need to specify the database name if you are using that method to obtain your connections.

#### CasE SEnSiTiVitY

SQL table and column names are **case-sensitive** on the AutoGrader. However, some operating systems, like Windows, treat names as **case-insensitive**, which can cause issues when submitting your project. Double-check capitalization in your SQL code to avoid errors.

- Double-check the casing in all of your SQL statements.
  - For example, if you have table named `foobar`, then you cannot later attempt to access it as `FooBar` (notice the capitalization change).
- Make sure each **table** and **column** name uses the same casing each time you use it.
  - Verify that the capitalization used in your `CREATE TABLE tablename` statements exactly matches all other uses, like in `INSERT INTO tablename`.
  - Verify that the capitalization used in all references to table names are exactly the same. This includes references in:
    - `CREATE TABLE` statement
    - `INSERT INTO` statements
    - Any other statements making reference to column names like `SELECT` or `WHERE` clauses.
    - `ResultSet.get*()` or similar functions which require a column name
- Storing table names and/or column names in **variables** gives a reliable foundation to avoid this kind of problem.
